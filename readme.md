# Friend-Finder
_Find your next friend! Using Friend-Finder, users are asked to complete a brief 10 question survey about themselves in order to find a new friend with the closest compatability rating._

Each time a user submits their survey responses this app searches through the existing 'Friends List API', calculates the closest match for each response, and provides the user with the name and photo of their new friend.
